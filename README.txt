Welcome to my 4YP folder. 

This project is a continuation of Justin's prvious work on a neural net work. His neural network can produce a custom wavelet that can recontruct a signal.
My main contribution was to add quantization and entropy encoding to the pipeline and to make sure the cost function also tries to reduce entropy.
