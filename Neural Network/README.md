Hi! Welcome to my 4YP repository. If you run the 'train_network.m' script, you will begin to train a 4 coefficient network for reconstruction straight away. You can tweak the neural network architecture, and switch to training a 2 coefficient network by making changes to 'train_network.m'.

I have also included 2 pre-trained networks for reconstruction: One of them outputs 2 coefficient filters, while the other outputs 4 coefficient filters. All you have to do is to load them into your workspace, and run 'analyse_network_2coeff.m' or 'analyse_network_4coeff.m', depending on which pre-trained network you would like to analyse.
